In this section we'll further drill into media upload and error handling in Ricos.

## Upload Functions API

This functions should be passed to the media plugins via config \ helpers (i.e image, gallery, video and file upload).

```jsx
handleFileUpload: (files: File[], updateEntity: UpdateEntityFunction) => void
handleFileSelection: (updateEntity: UpdateEntityFunction) => void
```

`handleFileUpload` is a function provided to handle media uploads from the native file input. <br />
`handleFileSelection` is a function provided to handle media uploads from a custom file input.

In both functions when the upload phase is done the `updateEntity` callback should be called with an object containing the data, error (upon faliure) and index (for multiple file uploads).

```jsx
UpdateEntityFunction<T>: ({ data: T, error: MediaUploadError, index: number }) => void
```

## Media Plugins `data` schemes

### Image and Gallery

```jsx
data?: {
  id: string,
  original_file_name: string,
  file_name: string,
  width: number,
  height: number,
}
```

### Video

```jsx
data?: {
  pathname: string,
  thumbnail: {
    pathname: string,
    height: number,
    width: number,
  },
}
```

### File Upload

```jsx
data?: {
  name: string;
  type: string;
  url?: string;
  id?: string;
}
```

## Errors

In order to take advantage of Ricos stunning error toasts and general error handling a proper `error` object of type `MediaUploadError` should be passed. <br />
Passing an error object triggers a toast indicating what caused the upload to fail as well as an indication of the error on the block. <br />
Using the `getContent` method of RicosEditor would also remove all blocks with errors from the content, thus they won't be seen on Viewer nor saved. <br />

```jsx
MediaUploadError?: {
  msg?: string | JSX.Element;
  key?: MediaUploadErrorKey;
  args?: Record<string, string | number>;
}
```

`msg` is a simple string or JSX Element to use for custom error messages to be displayed. <br />
`key` is an enum with our built in supported and localized error types. <br />
`args` are arguments needed for the built in toasts. <br />

```jsx
enum MediaUploadErrorKey {
  GENERIC,
  SIZE_LIMIT,
  QUOTA_STORAGE_VISITOR,
  QUOTA_STORAGE_OWNER,
  QUOTA_VIDEO_VISITOR,
  QUOTA_VIDEO_OWNER,
}
```

`GENERIC` a general error with no specific reason <br />
`SIZE_LIMIT` the file is too big to upload, supports an argument `maxLimit` for maximum file size indication. <br />
`QUOTA_STORAGE_VISITOR` file storage exceeded the limit (UoU). <br />
`QUOTA_STORAGE_OWNER` file storage exceeded the limit (User), supports an argument `upgradeUrl` to upgrade the site's plan. <br />
`QUOTA_VIDEO_VISITOR` video hours on the site have reached the maximum (UoU). <br />
`QUOTA_VIDEO_OWNER` video hours on the site have reached the maximum (User), supports an argument `upgradeUrl` to upgrade the site's plan. <br />
