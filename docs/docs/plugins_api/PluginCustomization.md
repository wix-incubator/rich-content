## Motivation

As it turns out, various `RichContentEditor` consumers have different customization needs. On other hand, it is important to keep the public API clean, while providing the desired customability. In order to meet these requirements, the `RichContentEditor` exposes `config` object prop.

This document focuses on plugin customization capabilities.

## Plugin Types as `config` Keys

Every plugin exports a constant value that defines its type. The convention is to name the type according to the _`pluginName_TYPE`_ pattern. The type is actually a plugin identifier, so it has to be unique.

The type serves multiple purposes. It is used to map the [entities](https://draftjs.org/docs/advanced-topics-entities) to proper plugin components both in `RichContentEditor` and `RichContentViewer`. Another plugin type application is `config` keys.

Every plugin expects to find its custom settings within the `config[pluginName_TYPE]` field. The expected value is an object containing specific settings that vary for every plugin. The following sections provide a list of plugin settings. As usual, the list is a subject to change.

## Plugin Settings

### Common Settings

These settings are common to all the plugins and handled at the **base** plugin level.

#### `width` and `height`

The `width` and `height` are expected to be integers. They serve as **initial** plugin component dimensions in pixels, if there are no `width` and `height` fields defined in `componentData.config` for that specific plugin entity.

#### `toolbar`

The `toolbar` setting refers to the plugin functionality toolbar, it is an object which may consist of the following keys:

| setting key | description                                                                                 | default value | is required? | editor/viewer config |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| `hidden`    | an array of toolbar button `keynames` to be removed from toolbar                            | none          | No           | editor               |
| `icons`     | an object of toolbar button `keynames` to custom icons map: `{ delete: MyCustomTrashIcon }` | none          | No           | editor               |

Currently, it exposes a field `hidden` which is expected to be an array of toolbar button `keynames` to be removed from toolbar and a field `icons` which is expected to be an object of button icons to replace the existing icons.

#### `defaultData`

The `defaultData` setting enables consumers to set the default data for a plugin when it is inserted into the editor.  It is an object with the same fields as the plugins entity data.

The Link Preview Plugin is implemented within the Link Plugin, and is activated once the Link Plugin Settings object contains `preview` field. The `preview` object structure as follows:

```js

  {
    getMetadataUrl: (query: string) => string,
    token: string,
    format: string,
  }

```

The `getMetadataUrl` should provide a Website metadata service endpoint URL for a given query URL. The `token` is a security token appended  to request headers (`Authorization` header). The `format`  is the expected response format. Currently the only supported format is 'oembed'.

| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| `colorScheme`             | custom-style to hex-color map: `{ color1: { color: '#fff', index: 0 }, ... }`          | none (DEFAULT_PALETTE is used by default)    | No           | editor               |

| `customStyleFn` (2)       | a function that converts an inline-style to CSS style: `string => object`              | DEFAULT_STYLE_FN                             | No           | viewer               |
| `selectionColor`          | selected color indicator (`string`)                                                    | `#000`                                       | No           | editor               |
| `onColorAdded`            | a handler called when a custom color is added                                          | none                                         | Yes          | editor               |
| `getUserColors`           | a function that returns user-defined custom colors                                     | none                                         | Yes          | editor               |
| `onCustomPickerToggle`    | a handler called when the Add Color button is clicked [see **Note** below for details] | modal `CustomColorPickerDialog` is displayed | No           | editor               |
| `onCustomColorPicked`     | a handler called when a custom color is picked by hue/saturation controls              | noop                                         | No           | editor               |

**Note:** `onCustomPickerToggle` API is intended to be used when there is a need to display the `CustomColorPicker` outside the modal dialog, e.g. as a Settings panel element. The API is called with the following parameters:
- `onCustomColorPicked`(color) -- should be called when a custom color is picked by hue/saturation controls of the `CustomColorPicker`. Usually it should be wired to the `CustomColorPicker`'s _`onChange`_ prop
- `onCustomColorUpdate`(color) -- should be called when user decides to apply the selected color (e.g. `CustomColorPickerDialog` Update button)
- `onCustomColorCancel`(color) -- should be called when user decides to cancel the custom color selection (e.g. `CustomColorPickerDialog` Cancel button)
- all the `ColorPicker` props (`t`, `isMobile`, `theme`, ...etc)

**Note**: `selectionColor` prop is deprecated, please override the `.colorPicker_button_selected::after` class `border-color` rule (theme).

#### Text Color Inline Style Mapper
The `RichContentViewer` exposes the `inlineStyleMappers` prop. The mapper purpose is to provide a mapping `inlineStyle => Component`, that is used by the `RichContentViewer`. The prop value is expected to be an array of functions of the following signature:

```js

() => {
  style1: {children, { key }} => <Component1 .../>,
  style2: {children, { key }} => <Component2 .../>,
  ...
}

```

Specifically, the `textColorInlineStyleMapper` API accepts two parameters -- `config` and `raw` (aka ContentState), and returns the mapper array. The custom inline styles are picked from the `raw` according to the `styleSelectionPredicate`, and the style conversion is performed by the `customStyleFn` (2). Both APIs should be provided by the consumer within `config` object.
