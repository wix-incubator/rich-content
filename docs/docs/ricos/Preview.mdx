## Introduction

Ricos editor is able to switch between several modes of previewing content that is being created within the editor itself.

A similar concept is sometimes used in social media applications (like previewing how a website link would expand into a card, or how user-generated text would look on a background). The Preview mode creates a shortened content display, ready to be expanded and is based on rules that can be modified.

The core idea is to transform the content state and to display it within `RicosViewer`. This transformation is a product of content state metadata and a set of rules defined by the consumer.

It's really best to see it in action, and we suggest you check out visual examples on our [storybook page](http://rich-content-storybook-master.surge.sh/?path=/story/preview--rules).

## Example

```jsx {9}
import { createPreview } from 'wix-rich-content-preview';
import 'wix-rich-content-preview/dist/styles.min.css
//
//
render() {
  const { content } = this.props;
  return (
    <RicosViewer
      content={content}
      preview={createPreview()}
    />
  );
}
```

## Tweaking the Preview

There are 3 fields which can be configured (optional):

```jsx
createPreview({ transformation, contentInteractionMappers, onPreviewExpand });
```

### `transformation`

The transformation consists of:

- the predicate the content metadata is tested for
- an action to perform if the predicate returns `true`

Example:

```js

  _if: metadata => metadata.images.length >= 4,
  _then: (metadata, preview) => preview.gallery({
      items: metadata.images.slice(0, 4),
      config: { layout: 'grid', imageWidth: 40 }
  }).imageCounter({ counter: metadata.images.length - 4 })

```

The example above defines the following transformation rule: "if content contains more than 4 images, the preview should display four of them as a grid gallery with image counter above the last image".

- default value: [Default Transformation](https://github.com/wix/ricos/blob/master/packages/preview/web/src/Components/default-transformation.ts)

### `contentInteractionMappers`

Allows passing interaction mappings, similar to `typeMappers` and `inlineStyleMappers`.

#### Content Interactions

Content interactions indicate that the preview content is collapsed and provide a way to expand it. Content interactions work at a block level and every interaction comprises the following elements:

- The `preview` builder parameter - allows adding an interaction to the preview state and configuring it.

  ```js

    preview.plain('some looong text').readMore({ lines: 5 }).image({ mediaInfo: {...} })

  ```

  In the example above, the `readMore` interaction is being applied to the previous `plain` block.

- `block data interactions array` - contains configuration data for all interactions applied to the block
- `UI component` - defines the appearance of the interaction element

##### Predefined Interactions

The `wix-rich-content-preview` introduces three predefined interactions (which include both preview builder API and UI components): `Image Counter`, `See Full Post`, and `Read More`.

###### Read More

The `Read More` interaction shortens textual content to a set number of lines and appends an ellipsis at the end.

###### See Full Post

The `See Full Post` displays a text label over an overlay. Mouse click expands the full content.

###### Image Counter

The `Image Counter` displays hidden image counter. By default, the counter `+N` label is placed above the last visible image element. The image elements are selected by the `role='img'` attribute.

- default value: [Default Interaction Map](https://github.com/wix/ricos/blob/master/packages/preview/web/src/Interactions/interactionMap.tsx)

---

### `onPreviewExpand`

A callback that's triggered upon preview expand click. Occurs once in a viewer session.

- default value: undefined
