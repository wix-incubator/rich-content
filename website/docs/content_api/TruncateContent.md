```js
truncateContent = (
  content: RicosContent,
  opts?: { wordsCount?: number; maxPlugins?: number; blocksCount?: number }
): { content: RicosContent; isTruncated: boolean }  
```

Truncate existing content according to number of blocks, and optional words count and/or plugin count.


The content will be truncated by the first limit reached.
For example passing `blocksCount=5`, `wordsCount=100`, `maxPlugins=3` will yield a content that is not more than 5 blocks, shorter than 100 words and have no more than 3 plugin blocks

#### Example Usage

```js
import { truncateContent } from 'ricos-content/libs/truncateContent';
const {content} = truncateContent(fullContent, 4)
<RicosViewer content={content} ... />
```
